          <p className="text-sm">{`This doesn't cover everything of course.  Foot and ankle health is another overlooked area... Barefoot shoes and toe spacers can help loosen cramped feet from years in tight shoes, which `}<em>could</em>{` help with arch and plantar fasciitis issues ðŸ¤·`}</p>
          <p className="text-sm mt-3">{`Pair that with stretches on a slant board (or better, deficit jefferson curls), and now you're also loosening your tight calves and hamstrings and lower back. And hanging is great for your shoulders and ribs.`}</p>
          <p className="text-sm mt-3">{`The thing with stretching is, a lot of issues associated with muscle tightness, particularly in areas like the hip flexor that are key to mobility, are really strength issues. So, stretch (and breath deep when you stretch), but if you can use weights by hanging or grabbing a dumbell, then use weights.  `}<em className="font-semibold">{`Strengthening your body in the lenghtened position will actually improve your "flexibility" (range of motion) faster and more sustainably.`}</em></p>
          <p className="text-sm mt-3">{`You can do downward dog and stretch your hamstrings vertically but you still can't twist and you're not making strength gains that would help even more with posture or mobility.  It's like training arms by just pushing your palms together as hard and as long as you can. It's something, but it's not much.`}</p>
          <p className="text-sm mt-3">{`Instead, exercises like split squats, jefferson curls, and cable flies that emphasize strength through a full range of motion will make you both more flexible and more able to take advantage of that flexibility.`}</p>
          <p className="text-sm mt-3">{`Even passively, I'll often stretch my ribs by grabbing a dumbbell and holding it over my head to the far side to stretch the rib of the arm holding the dumbbell. It's a quick stretch because weight is pulling on it, and it provides more strength gains to maintain the stretched range of motion. Win win win.`}</p>

          <p className="text-sm mt-4">{`The main reason I like push/pull is because it promotes balance from the start.  I advocate for mixing in single-leg pistol squats, RDLs and dumbbell work to maintain a left-right balance, but before all that is a simple push-pull.`}</p>
          <p className="text-sm mt-4">{`Your quads and hamstrings should be strong together. Your back and chest should be strong together. Push/pull gets at this and also accounts for the need to train your back and chest horizontally and vertically (Rows & Bench, Pull-ups & Pull-downs/Presses). If you have no goal in mind, start here.`}</p>
